# HuffmanCoding
The Huffman Coding is done using the encoder and the decoder. A text file is encoded to a binary file and sent to the decoder to decode the binary file back to text file. The data structures used for this are: 1. Binary Heap 2. Four-way Heap 3. Pairing Heap

The project is aimed at implementing Huffman encoding and decoding process using priority queues.

The project is divided in three steps:

1. Implementation of Huffman tree using Binary Heap, 4 way cache optimized heap and pairing heap and determining which is the best priority queue in terms of timings.

2. Determining the best data structure,implement Huffmanen coding using that which will generate two files â€“ compressed version of input file and code table.

3. After encoding, we need to decompress and decode the data which will take as input the output of step 2 and generate decoded.txt.
